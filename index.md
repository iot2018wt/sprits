# SPRITS 2018

## First international workshop on <br>Semantic Processing and Reasoning for IoT Systems

**An event of the [IoT 2018 conference](http://iot-conference.org/iot2018), October 15-18 2018, Santa Barbara, California**

This is the first edition of the SPRITS workshop. The topics of the workshop are complementary to the main conference, as it puts a semantic view on top of the IoT, to apply semantic processing or semantic reasoning. 

This semantic view relies on the semantic Web and its well-known stack. People at the crossroads of Semantic Web and Internet of Things are fully concerned by the topics of this workshop. Today, a very active community works on the Web of Things and can be attracted to the workshop and its hosting conference. More precisely, this workshop aims at bringing together research communities such as edge computing, embedded processing, low-end/constrained devices, semantic interoperability, data deduction, standard-based and open infrastructures.

### Organization and Format

SPRITS will be held as a half-day workshop, comprising a keynote and paper presentations. The date and keynote will be annouced soon on this page.

We call for research and in-use papers:

  - research papers should report on novel research contributions addressing theoretical, analytical and empirical aspects of semantic processing and reasoning techniques in the Internet of Things.
  - in-use papers should demonstrate the use of semantic processing and reasoning in actual or realistic setups or situations.

Authors are invited to submit papers in any of these categories in a long (8 pages) or short (4 pages) format. Accepted papers will be published on CEUR (http://ceur-ws.org/). See our [Call for Papers](https://iot2018wt.github.io/sprits/cfp) for more details about the submission process.
